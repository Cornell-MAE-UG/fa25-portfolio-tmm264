For a class, we were tasked with designing blades for a wind turbine that maximized the power generation from a given range of windspeeds.  Our blades had to operate within a set range of wind speeds while generating power and without succumbing to brittle failure.  Furthermore, our turbine was to have a rated RPM at which it generated maximum power.

With maximizing turbine power as our goal, we designed our blades around maximizing torque and RPM.  We selected a high rotational velocity of 2000 RPM as our rated RPM, before focusing on torque generation.  Torque is primarily generated by the blade’s lift force, while drag contributes to undesirable thrust forces, so we wanted an airfoil with a high ratio of lift coefficient to drag coefficient.  With that, we selected a NACA 4415 airfoil for our blade cross section. We then wanted to compute the optimal pitch and chord along the length of the blade so that our blade generated the maximum amount of torque at our rated RPM.  We used a MATLAB script that split the length of the blade into discrete elements and computed the aerodynamic forces on these elements.  The script would iterate through different combinations of pitch and chord along the length of the blade until it found values that resulted in a maximum generated torque.  With the results from the script and our airfoil selection, we constructed CAD models of our blades.

We wanted to validate the blades’ performances across different wind speeds and rotation rates.  The approach we took was gathering power curves at different wind speeds in a wind tunnel for our blades.  We assembled our wind turbine within the wind tunnel’s test section and used its speed control and a Pitot-static tube to adjust and monitor the wind speed.  At different wind speeds, we progressively increased voltage to the torque brake, steadily increasing torque while decreasing the turbine’s RPM, allowing us to steadily collect power-RPM data to build power curves.

My contributions to this project were determining the wind speed used in design, and creating the testing procedure.  I used a MATLAB script to determine the statistically most likely wind speed, arriving at a speed of 7 m/s to use in our design scripts that determined chord and pitch along the blades.  I also wrote the testing procedure, detailing the protocol for collecting the power curves while adding in safety provisions to ensure all testing equipment was kept within its operating ranges.
