The Boeing 737 MAX disaster was unquestionably a tragedy.  The aircraft's MCAS software directly led to crashes and deaths.

The 737 MAX was produced on an accelerated timeline due to industry pressures from competitors like Airbus.  A notable change in the MAX from the regular 737 was its use of larger engines.  This altered the location of the center of gravity of the aircraft, neccessitating MCAS to help with pitch stability.  Importantly, MCAS relied on a single angle of attack sensor, and it produced nose-down corection without pilot input.  Furthermore, pilots were not informed about MCAS in their 737 MAX training.

These design decisions were compounded with decisions from key Boeing executives.  Among others, they made the decisions to rely on single AOA sensors and reuse the 737 frame in the MAX.  Importantly, they also knew about the potential risks of MCAS but did not bring this safety issue to light.

This points to further systemic, organizational issues that contributed to the disaster.  There was a key disconnect in concerns over safety between individual contributors and Boeing executives.  Complexities regarding regulation authority between the FAA and Boeing also contributed to this issue.

Knowing all of this now, there are key steps that contributors to the tragedy should have taken.  For instance, the FAA should have taken more ownership over aviation regulatory powers instead of devolving them to Boeing.  Additionally, Boeing executives should have held public safety paramount in their practices.  Furthermore, Boeing engineers could have followed professional ethics codes and tried to alert the public or media of the risks of MCAS
